    "An **algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules for solving a problem or completing a task. Think of it as a recipe - it tells you exactly what to do, in what order, to achieve a desired result.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Correctness**: The algorithm produces the correct output for all valid inputs\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**: The algorithm uses reasonable time and memory resources\n",
    "3. **Clarity**: The algorithm is easy to understand and implement\n",
    "4. **Generality**: The algorithm works for a range of inputs, not just one specific case"
